# HCC_Immunity

## Background information
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection contributes to roughly 50% of all hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the most common form ofr liver cancer. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA), the human equivalent of major histocompatibility complex (MHC), is a group of proteins that the immune system uses to detect pathogens. HLA is highly polymorphic, especially in the peptide-binding groove, and this allows the HLA to bind a wide range of peptides. 

In this project, we are interested in:
1. Is HLA associated with HBV-mediated liver cancer?
2. How is HBV binding affinity related to HBV-mediated liver cancer? 

This project can be split into three parts:
1. Predict HLA binding to HBV peptides
2. Gather allele frequency from liver cancer population and the general population
3. Perform Fisher's test to test allele association with HBV-mediated liver cancer
